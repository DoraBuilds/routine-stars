# Deployment hardening

Tracks issue #60: a minimum production security-header baseline for this app.

## Current host: GitHub Pages (custom domain `www.littleloops.xyz`)

GitHub Pages does not support custom HTTP response headers. That means real
`Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options` / `frame-ancestors`, and
`X-Content-Type-Options` headers **cannot be set** on this host, no matter
what's in the repo — there's no config file or dashboard setting for it.

## What's covered today (via `<meta>` in `index.html`)

A `Content-Security-Policy` and `Referrer-Policy` are delivered via `<meta
http-equiv>` tags, since those two (unlike the ones above) are allowed to be
set that way:

- `script-src 'self'` — blocks any injected/inline script from executing
- `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com` —
  `unsafe-inline` is required because the app uses React inline `style={{}}`
  props extensively (they render as `style="..."` attributes); tightening
  this would mean rewriting every inline style to a class, which is a much
  larger change than this issue scoped
- `font-src`, `img-src`, `connect-src` — scoped to `self` plus this app's
  actual Supabase project and Google Fonts, nothing else
- `worker-src 'self' blob:` — without this, `worker-src` falls back to
  `script-src 'self'`, which blocks `canvas-confetti`'s animation worker
  (loaded from a `blob:` URL). That silently killed all confetti in the app
  (fixed in #162) with no thrown error, just a console CSP violation —
  easy to miss in manual testing since the rest of the page works fine.
- `referrer` meta tag set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

Verified against a real production build (`vite preview` + headless
Chromium): zero CSP violations across `/`, `/parent/schedules`,
`/auth/callback`, and the 404 route, fonts load correctly, and a real
`signInWithOtp` request to Supabase went through (got a real API response,
not a CSP block).

**Per the CSP spec, `frame-ancestors`, `report-uri`, and `sandbox` are
silently ignored when delivered via `<meta>`.** They only work as a real HTTP
header — see below.

## What's NOT covered, and what to do about it

Clickjacking protection (`frame-ancestors`), HSTS, and
`X-Content-Type-Options` need a real HTTP header, which means putting
something in front of GitHub Pages that can add headers. The common
zero-cost option is **Cloudflare** (free tier) proxying the `littleloops.xyz`
domain instead of pointing DNS straight at GitHub Pages.

If/when that's set up, add a Cloudflare Worker (or a Transform Rule, if the
plan supports response-header transforms) that adds these headers to every
response:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const response = await fetch(request);
    const headers = new Headers(response.headers);
    headers.set('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload');
    headers.set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
    headers.set('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
    // frame-ancestors is redundant with X-Frame-Options above, but include
    // it too since it's the modern replacement and some browsers prefer it.
    headers.append('Content-Security-Policy', "frame-ancestors 'none'");
    return new Response(response.body, { status: response.status, headers });
  },
};
```

This isn't set up — it needs a Cloudflare account and a DNS change, both
outside what can be done from this repo. Until then, clickjacking protection
for this app is effectively undocumented/absent, which is the residual risk
this issue originally flagged.

## Verification

To re-check after any change to the CSP meta tag:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview -- --port 4173
```

Then load `http://localhost:4173` in a browser with devtools open and watch
the console for `Refused to ...` / `Content Security Policy` violation
messages while clicking through the app's main flows (landing, sign-in
attempt, setup, routine view, parent settings, schedules).
